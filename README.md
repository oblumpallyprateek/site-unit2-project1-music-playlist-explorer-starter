  - [x] When the heart icon is clicked:
    - [x] If previously unliked:
      - [x] The like count on the playlist tile should increase by 1.
      - [x] There should be visual feedback (such as the heart turning a different color) to show that the playlist has been liked by the user.
    - [x] If previously liked:
      - [x] The like count on the playlist tile should decrease by 1.
      - [x] There should be visual feedback (such as the heart turning a different color) to show that the playlist has been unliked by the user.
    - [x] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** In addition to showcasing the above features, for ease of grading, please film yourself liking and unliking:
      - [x] a playlist with a like count of 0
      - [x] a playlist with a non-zero like count

- [x] **Shuffle Songs**
  - [x] Enable users to shuffle the songs within a playlist using a shuffle button in the playlist's detail modal.
  - [x] When the shuffle button is clicked, the playlist's songs should display in a different order.
  - [x] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** In addition to showcasing the above features, for ease of grading, please show yourself shuffling the same playlist more than once. 
  
- [x] **Featured Page**
  - [x] Application includes a dedicated page that randomly selects and displays a playlist, showing the playlist’s:

      - [x] Title
      - [x] Artist
      - [x] Duration
  - [x] When the page is refreshed or reloaded, a new random playlist is displayed
    - For example, navigating to the all playlists page and then back to the featured playlist page should result in a new random playlist being displayed
    - Note that because your algorithm will not be truly random, it is possible that the same playlist will feature twice in a row. 
    - [x] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** In addition to showcasing the above features, for ease of grading, please show yourself refreshing the featured page more than once. 
  - [x] Application includes a navigation bar or some other mechanism such that users can navigate to the page with all playlists from the featured page and vice versa without using the browser's back and forward buttons. 

- [x] **Planning Documentation**
  - [x] Repository includes a `planning.md` file with:
    - [x] A **Data Shape** section (fields and types for playlist and song objects)
    - [x] A **UI and Interaction Rules** section (at least three rules describing what happens in the UI for a user action)
    - [x] At least one **Function Spec** (name, purpose, inputs, outputs, side effects)
    - [x] A **Featured Page** section describing the random playlist display behavior
    - [x] A **Decisions Log** with entries from at least two different milestones

- [x] **AI-Powered Playlist Description**
  - [x] The playlist detail modal includes a "Get Description" button.
  - [x] Clicking the button calls an AI API and displays a generated description within the modal.
  - [x] `planning.md` includes an **AI Feature Spec** documenting role, task, inputs, output format, constraints, and failure behavior.
  - [x] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** For ease of grading, open your browser's DevTools Network tab, click the "Get Description" button, and show the outbound request going directly to an AI API URL (e.g., `openrouter.ai`).

      - **Note:** You will not be graded on the implementation of this optional subfeature to keep your grade of this stretch feature independent of your implementation of other stretch features.

  - [x] Selecting a sort option should result in a reordering based on the selected sort while maintaining a grid view.

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The labs covered the fundamentals pretty well - DOM manipulation, event listeners, and basic JavaScript were solid foundations. However, I felt less prepared for the modal implementation, especially getting the overlay backdrop and centering to work correctly with flexbox. The AI API integration was also new territory since we didn't cover async/await and fetch requests with authorization headers in as much depth. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have implemented persistent storage using localStorage so that likes, edits, and new playlists survive page refreshes. Right now everything resets when you reload. I'd also add form validation for the duration field to ensure it matches the mm:ss format, and maybe add a music player preview feature using embedded Spotify or YouTube links.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The demo went smoothly overall - all features worked as expected and I was able to showcase the full CRUD functionality and AI integration without any bugs. The shuffle working multiple times and the like/unlike toggle both demonstrated well. One thing that didn't go as planned was that my CSS grid initially broke on a different screen resolution during the demo, but I had tested it beforehand so I knew to zoom out.
